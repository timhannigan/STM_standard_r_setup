# An R Notebook for Rendering with Structural Topic Modeling

### This is a template for STM work by the IDeaS Group 2022

This will be shown as part of the IDeaS workshop @ UBC May 4-7, 2022.

Use this by cloning the repo for each rendering project you have. This will set up the folder structure and provide you with a Jupyter notebook for preparing the corpus for STM analysis. There is also a R notebook for doing the STM work.
