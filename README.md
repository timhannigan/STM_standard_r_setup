# STM_standard_r_setup

### This is a template for STM work by the IDeaS Group 2022 (mostly by Tim Hannigan)

Use this by cloning the repo for each rendering project you have. This will set up the folder structure and provide you with a Jupyter notebook for preparing the corpus for STM analysis. There is also a R notebook for doing the STM work.
