# An R Notebook for Rendering with Structural Topic Modeling

### This is a template for STM work by the IDeaS Group 2022 
([http://www.interpretivedatascience.com])

This will be shown as part of the IDeaS workshop @ UBC May 4-7, 2022.

Use this by cloning the repo for each rendering project you have. This will set up the folder structure and provide you with an R notebook for preparing the corpus for STM analysis. There is also a R notebook for doing the STM work.

For more info, contact Tim Hannigan: [tim.hannigan@ualberta.ca]

This draws heavily from work on the rendering process by Hannigan et al. (2019) and the wonderful work of Lindstedt (2019). If you use this notebook in your papers, please try to cite:
